# ReceiptVision: Donut-Powered Document Intelligence

## Project Description
ReceiptVision is a streamlined AI system that fine-tunes the Donut Vision Transformer (ViT) to automate the conversion of receipts into structured JSON data. By focusing on real-world usability, the project eliminates the inefficiencies of manual data entry, delivering precise extraction of transaction details (e.g., dates, totals, vendor names) even from low-quality scans or handwritten notes.

## Why It Stands Out:

- OCR-Free Design: Leverages Donutâ€™s end-to-end document understanding, bypassing traditional OCR error-prone pipelines.
- Domain Adaptability: Easily extendable to invoices, tickets, or forms with minimal retraining.
- Developer-Friendly: Includes a lightweight API wrapper for integration into apps, workflows, or cloud services.
